# Database-Concepts
This is one of my Masters courses. It covers three level database architecture. The relational database model and relational algebra. SQL and its use in database procedures and with conventional programming languages. Entity relationship modeling. Functional dependencies and normalization. Transactions, concurrency and recovery. Here I have the ER diagram model of the final project given in the course. It has the explaination and ER diagram images with the SQl commands.
